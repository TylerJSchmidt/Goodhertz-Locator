# Locate Goodhertz
One of the most frustrating things is when you go into a new studio for the first time and find your favorite audio plug-ins aren't installed. My favorite plug-ins are created by a company called Goodhertz(If you haven't heard of them I highly recommend taking a listen https://goodhertz.co). I built this simple script for Mac that scans your plugin directory to see if you have the Goodhertz plug-in library is installed. If not it will refer you to their downloads page. Once installed it scans your plugin directory again to verify they were downloaded correctly.

Enjoy!
