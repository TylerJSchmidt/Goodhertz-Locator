# Locate Goodhertz
One of the most frustrating things is when you go into a new studio for the first time and find they don't have your favorite audio plug-ins installed. My favorite plug-ins are created by a company called Goodhertz(If you haven't heard of them check them out). I build this simple script for Mac that scans your plugin directory to see if you have the Goodhertz plug-in library is installed. If not it will refer you to their download page. Once installed it scans your plugin directory again to verify they were downloaded correctly.

To run this script copy and paste the following line of code into terminal: python Downloads/Goodhertz-Locator-main/Goodhertzlocator.py

Enjoy!
