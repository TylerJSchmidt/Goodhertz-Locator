# Goodhertz-Locator
One of the most frustrating things is to go into a new studio and not have the plugins you need to start working on an audio projects! My favorite third party plugins are created by a company called Goodhertz(If you haven't heard of them check it out). I build this simple script for Mac computers that scans your plugin directory to see if you have the Goodhertz plugin pack installed. If its not it will refer you to their download page and allow you to rescan to insure the plugins have been downloaded correctly.

To run this script copy and paste the following line of code into terminal: python Downloads/Goodhertz-Locator-main/Goodhertzlocator.py

Enjoy!
